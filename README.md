# XStreamTestSuite
Developed a test suite for the open-source java library xstream (https://github.com/jolice/xstream/) with 99% line coverage. I used TestNG as the testing framework and also some mockito

# Usage
1. Clone the repository 
2. Open the project with your java IDE
3. Run the test suite 

# What did I learned?
- writing tests with TestNG
- writing basic mocks with mockito
- creating a java project with testing
